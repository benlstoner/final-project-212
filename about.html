            <p>Gyran Bop is a dish that originated in Korea, but doesn't have to be made traditionally Korean.</p>

        <div class="about">
            <p>When I first started cycling, every morning before a ride I would have avocado toast with egg. Soon I found I would feel bloated and heavy during my ride. So I decided I needed to find another way to get the same carbohydrates, without all the filler.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about">
            <p>Further research led me to find that most professionals eat omelletes with rice, due to the low fiber and high carb nature, along with fats and proteins from the egg. I later discovered that this dish is traditionally called "Gyeran Bap" from a Korean friend of mine.</p>
